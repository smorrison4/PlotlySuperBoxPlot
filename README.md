# BQ-AutoComplete
The javascript PlotlySuperBoxPlot uses the public domain Plotly.js library to make a Plotly Box Plot with the selected items highlight in blue and red.
It is released under the MIT License: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
(Plotly.js is also under the MIT license.)

This can be useful if you want a regular box plot (aka box and whisker plot) but you want to compare one or two things relative to everything else.
